    <body>
        <br><br>The only permission needed for MatTalX to work properly is "Storage". It is used to store your work in progress, if any. 
        The text written in the first box (input) right before closing MatTalX is saved, so that you are able to change tab and continue the 
        text you started without having to start over.
