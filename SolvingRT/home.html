    <div class="introduction"><p>
        The primary goal of SolvingRT is to quantify exercise mechanics, to be able to standardize the technique or tempo used while doing a lift. 
        This can be used to make experimental studies more rigorous â€” for instance by making sure that the velocity is kept the same while performing a movement 
        in a research on mind-muscle connection. Also, it would reduce the cost, or increase the reliability of longitudinal studies by making it possible for subjects 
        to film themselves while training and use the videos to, again, standardize the movement quality.<br><br>

            <p class="preview">Most personal trainers and coaches will adjust the resistance training program based on 
            their clients preference. It will most likely be done through asking questions and through

        <h3>Power as a tool to represent tension</h3>
        <p class="preview">Numerous methods are being used to interpret how much a muscle works during an
            exercise; like the force output (or torque) of a muscle and the electrical signal transmission
            (electromyography (EMG)) or activation of a muscle. However, measuring...
