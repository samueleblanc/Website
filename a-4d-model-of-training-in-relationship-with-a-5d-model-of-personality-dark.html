        Most personal trainers and coaches will adjust the resistance training program based on their 
        clients preference. It will most likely be done through asking questions and through trial and 
        error. Others will use an unconventional method to assess what a specific client will prefer 
        called <i>“Neurotyping”</i>, which is quite popular among fitness enthusiasts and personal trainers. 
        Basically, it is a survey based test that tells you your “neurotype”. A neurotype is one’s 
        predominance in a certain neurotransmitter or a higher sensitivity to one. The obvious problems
         with this approach are that (a) there are currently no known methods to accurately assess 
         neurotransmitter dominance with a survey and (b) the level of a neurotransmitter changes 
         with time. Also, (c) neuroscientists won’t judge someone’s personality with neurotyping, 
         because of the two previous reasons and the simple fact that reducing personality traits to
          neurotransmitters is currently impossible, and probably always will be. Measuring neural 
          circuit activation (which are influenced by neurotransmitters and neuromodulators) is most 
          likely the next step in making predictions of someone’s likes and dislikes, and future 
          behaviors.<br><br>

        Currently, the most scientifically rigid method to assess personality is the <i>“Big-Five 
        personality traits”</i> model. It is higher in terms of abstraction, but much more accurate 
        and stable<sup><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165176511004666#:~:text=These%20traits%E2%80%93extraversion%2C%20agreeableness%2C,John%20and%20Srivastava%2C%202001)." target="_blank">1</a></sup> 
        than any other known method. The five dimensions are extraversion, agreeableness, 
        openness, conscientiousness and neuroticism.<br><br>

        The <a href="resistance-training-as-a-newtonian-4d-model-dark.html" target="_blank">four dimensional</a> 
        model of resistance training is attained with a reduction of the training 
        variables to physics. It is a descriptive model that uses three dimensions of space and one of 
        time to make an accurate description of a resistance training program.<br>

        <h3>Linking the two</h3>

        To make a useful bridge between personality and resistance training, the recommendations that 
        will come out will have to be subtler than “do X training style”. The reason is that, for 
        instance, asking an olympic weightlifter to mostly do yoga and slow movement is counterproductive, 
        even if he is prone to stress. It is a necessity to keep the main goal in mind.<br><br>

        Recommendations should therefore be about something of seemingly low importance. As an example, 
        people low in openness might prefer if it is written “Rest 90 seconds inbetween sets”, but 
        someone high in openness will maybe favor “Rest enough so that you partially recover, but don’t 
        take more than 2 minutes”. The difference in training stimulus will be extremely low, or 
        non-existent, but their adherence to the plan might increase drastically.<br>

        <h3>Implementation</h3>

        Creating a technology that can adjust its recommendation based on the underlying physics of 
        resistance training, periodization and personality — with the Big Five model — would be a major 
        step towards better gym related practices. To collect the necessary information to assess 
        personality traits a survey is currently the best approach, but using pictures might one day 
        become the simplest, and yet, effective approach.<sup><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65358-6" target="_blank">2</a></sup><br><br>

        For someone who is high in <strong>extraversion</strong>, replacing a coach with technology might be an inadequate 
        approach. It might lower their adherence to the training regiment since being with someone else 
        while resistance training or talking to someone once a week is a major factor in their constancy. 
        However, if that person can meet their social needs outside of the gym, this technology might not 
        be a problem. The software system should adapt to extraversion by increasing the frequency of 
        “check-ins” with the virtual coach.<br>

        <h3>Recommendations</h3>

        For anyone who is low in <strong>agreeableness</strong>, the virtual trainer should explain every decision, 
        or at least leave the choice for the user to read the explanation. It should also ask a lot
         of questions while creating the athlete’s profile to give more control to the user. For 
         someone who is high in <strong>neuroticism</strong>, it needs to find a way to reward the user more often,
          while giving them autonomy.<sup><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282515509_Effects_of_Neuroticism_on_Goal_Support_Goal_Progress_and_Depressive_Symptoms" target="_blank">3</a></sup> 
          It might be by making recommendations on goal setting. I also 
          don’t think that the training program recommended by the virtual coach should be extremely 
          precise, in case that the person feels like he or she failed, because of “non-compliance”. 
          For instance, taking 2 minutes in between sets instead of 90 seconds. Also, to give a sense 
          of subjective success, the software should be just strict enough while looking at the exercise 
          being performed from a space only perspective. Meaning that the force vector should be aligned 
          with the targeted muscle so that the user actually <i>feels</i> the appropriate muscle. The time 
          dimension should less be taken into account, since it could be sensed as being invasive, and 
          sometimes changing the velocity can help with the appreciation of a particular movement. For 
          someone high in <strong>openness</strong>, leaving room for exploration is a must. The virtual trainer should 
          therefore intervene only when necessary, while analysing the exercise mechanics and also 
          while creating a program. For every exercise in the program, it should give at least two 
          options. The options should be selected for their similarity in terms of the <a href="determining-a-mathematical-way-to-measure-resistance-profiles-dark.html" target="_blank">resistance 
          profile</a>. If there is a lack of possibility, it should make adjustments in the time dimension, 
          so that the <a href="training-stimulus-is-a-number-between-0-and-1-dark.html" target="_blank">outcome</a> of the exercise stays the same. On the other hand, someone who is low in 
          openness will probably prefer a training routine with less variations and changes. When a 
          change will be needed, the least drastic approach is to be prefered. That’s why simply using 
          the 4D model is a good idea, a simple change in tempo, for example, could sufficiently modify 
          the stimulus. For someone high in <strong>conscientiousness</strong>, setting a plan with goals is a must. 
          Compared with high neuroticism, the goals can be highly based on performance and the 
          preciseness is a little bit less important.<sup><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241699288_Goal-setting_in_practice_The_effects_of_personality_and_perceptions_of_the_goal-setting_process_on_job_satisfaction_and_goal_commitment" target="_blank">4</a></sup> 
          People low in conscientiousness might have 
          better results with a detailed plan, highly precise goals and a tighter, more frequent 
          follow-up. Since low conscientiousness is associated with acting without planning, the 
          training program should be built so that it is okay to change the time allocated to 
          training at the last minute, while being able to continue to achieve goals. This is where 
          making changes in the time dimension and the resistance profiles could be important, to 
          save time achieving a particular outcome. Also, it would be important in this scenario to 
          keep a tight focus on the second dimension of space, so that the user gets the most tension 
          out of every rep.<br>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        Making resistance training and personality traits entirely computable will make creating an 
        efficacious virtual trainer possible. Linking the two will increase adherence, since the 
        training regimens will be personalised.<br>
