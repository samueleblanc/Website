            This unofficial case study tried to find a better approach to measure how much
            tension is being applied to a muscle. There are currently two ways to measure the
            quantity of mechanical tension on a muscle. Either the distance from the tension to
            the joint that is moving multiplied by the weight. The other way is the distance
            between the resultant of forces from friction under your feet and from a perpendicular
            line in the middle of a foot because every force (from gravity or from another
            resistance) will be expressed by your feet, multiplied by the weight. Based on my
            finding, tension was in correlation with the first example.<br>
            <h3>Background and context</h3>
            Mechanical tension, which is the amount of tension applied on a muscle, seems to
            be the main driver of muscle hypertrophy.<sup><a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2010/10000/the_mechanisms_of_muscle_hypertrophy_and_their.40.aspx" target="_blank">
            1, </a></sup><sup><a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00685.2018" target="_blank">2</a></sup> 
            Even with metabolic stress, which is
            another driver of hypertrophy, you need to apply a certain amount of tension on a
            muscle to have an accumulation of metabolites and attain hypoxic and ischemic
            condition.<sup><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266084792_A_Review_on_the_Mechanisms_of_Blood-Flow_Restriction_Resistance_Training-Induced_Muscle_Hypertrophy" target="_blank">3</a></sup> 
            Therefore, being able to understand how much tension an exercise puts
            on the muscle you want to train would be useful, no matter if mechanotransduction,
            reactive oxygen species or lactate accumulation or muscle fiber recruitment is your
            goal.<br><br>
            As of right now, I am aware of two ways to try to determine the amount of tension on
            a specific muscle. The first one (Blue line) is to measure the distance parallel to the
            floor if the tension comes from gravity or perpendicular to the tension if you use
            cable for example, to the joint that is moving multiplied by the weight. The second
            way (Red lines) is the distance between the resultant of forces from friction under
            your feet, if there’s any, and from a perpendicular line in the middle of a foot
            multiplied by the weight. The thinking behind that theory is that every force (from
            gravity or from another resistance) will be expressed on the floor or other surface
            with your feet.<br><br> <img src="https://samueleblanc.com/Pictures/RDL vs SLD 2 tension.png" id="CSfirst" alt="RDL vs SLD" style="width: 35%; height: 35%;">
            When the goal is to find the amount of tension on a muscle from the upper
            body, everyone seems to utilize the first way. However, when some people want
            to find the amount of tension applied on a lower body muscle, they will use the
            second way.<br><br>
            Based on other science fields, a theory, for it to be great, should be able to answer
            its question every time. The famous saying “The exception that proves the rule”
            actually means that, when something seems like an exception, a rule or a theory
            should still be able to work. If it does, the theory “works”, until proven otherwise. If we
            translate that to the situation at hand, I think that the exception, or what seems to be,
            is when we try to calculate the tension applied on a lower body muscle. Everyone
            seems to agree that the first way is applicable with the upper body but some people
            think it doesn’t work on the lower body due to the role of friction, and the second way
            would be more appropriate. The same people also think that you shouldn’t measure
            from the weight to the moving joint but from the middle of the feet to the moving joint,
            probably because the weight is expressed on the floor under your feet. If you want to
            prove it, just step on a scale and measure your weight. Step again but try to move
            your center of mass by bending at the hips. You could also try with a weight in your
            hand, and then with the same weight but far from your body like with a shoulder
            flexion. You will see that the weight on the scale stays the same.<br>
            <h3>Methods</h3>
            The study was done on two subjects. Both participants were highly trained
            individuals. One of them was myself, and the person taking the results was not
            aware of the goal of the study. The other subject that participated was not aware of
            the goal of the study, but the person taking the results was myself. Due to the
            Covid-19 pandemic, I was only able to get these two persons (the one taking the
            results and the other participant) on two separate occasions and for a short amount
            of time. I was only able to try each scenario once.<br><br>
            The goal of this study was to measure the amount of weight the hip musculature was
            able to pull isometrically in a romanian deadlift and stiff leg deadlift. Since it was
            isometric with the bar at the knee level, the only difference was that, for the stiff leg
            deadlift, the bar was further from the body. Knee angles were similar (~35°) every
            time. To measure the weight being pulled, I attached a digital fish scale (Klau,
            illustrated as the orange line) to the floor and to the bar that already had 155lb on it.
            The results were filmed and then the average, since the weight was constantly
            changing, of the weight being pulled was calculated and added to the weight of the
            bar.<br><br>
            Both participants did the same 4 tests. A romanian deadlift (RDL), a stiff leg deadlift
            (SLD), a romanian deadlift with straps attached to the feet to counter the friction
            (RDL-F) and a stiff leg deadlift with straps attached to the feet to counter the friction
            (SLD-F). The straps are illustrated as the grey lines.<br><br> <img src="https://samueleblanc.com/Pictures/RDL vs SLD vs -F.png" id="CSsecond" alt="Visual representation" style="width: 65%; height: 65%;" class="center"><br><br>
            The visual representation is not perfect. During the SLD and SLD-F the subjects had a tendency
            to lean forward due to a change in center of mass, theoretically increasing friction
            compared to RDL but equal to RDL-F.<br><br>

            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            This study tried to demonstrate a better way of calculating tension between the two
            current methods. Based on the results, friction does not seem to affect the amount of
            weight a person can isometrically pull. However, there is a correlation between the
            amount of tension with RDL and SLD or with RDL-F and SLD-F when you use the
            first method, which is the distance perpendicular to the tension to the moving joint.
            There is no difference in the amount of weight being pulled no matter if there is
            friction or significantly less. If friction had an impact, there would be a blatant
            difference because, even if weight is further from you it wouldn’t have an impact.
            Therefore, someone could pull as much in a SLD than with a RDL if you diminish
            friction.<br><br>
            Someone could make the argument that the reason subjects lifted less in SLD and
            SLD-F is because of the instability of having the weight far from you and not because
            of friction or because the amount of tension differs due to the distance between the
            weight and joint.<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6443166/" target="_blank">4,</a></sup><sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5388079/" target="_blank">5</a></sup> 
            Is the weight more difficult to lift at the top of a (deltoids) lateral
            raise because of instability or because of the amount of tension? Or is it strictly
            because muscles are weaker when they are shortened?<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1392571/" target="_blank">6,</a></sup>
            <sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1357553/" target="_blank">7,</a></sup><sup><a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-essr/citation/1984/01000/human_strength_curves.14.aspx" target="_blank">8</a></sup>
            You could design the same
            experience but instead use cables with its pulley at the same height of your hands.
            The distance perpendicular between the tension (cable) and the moving joint
            (shoulder) would be at its furthest when the deltoids are lengthened. However, it is
            more difficult at the bottom of the movement and gets easier at the top. If you use
            that example, it means that you could not only use the fact that a muscle is
            shortened or not or instability to say if you can lift more or less weight. It seems that
            there is more to it, even if overall stability and sarcomere length are really important
            to determine your muscles capacity to generate force.<br><br>
            With the upper body musculature, it is well established among highly knowledgeable
            trainers, not scientists, that the best way of determining the amount of tension on a
            muscle is with the first method. It would make sense that the method that works for
            most skeletal muscles would work for all of them.<br><br>
            Are there any exceptions?<br><br>
            Some could say that the hip thrust is one of them. Why are the glutes the primary
            targeted muscle<sup><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325362852_Activation_of_the_Gluteus_Maximus_During_Performance_of_the_Back_Squat_Split_Squat_and_Barbell_Hip_Thrust_and_the_Relationship_With_Maximal_Sprinting" target="_blank">9</a></sup> 
            if there is no distance between the weight and the moving joint?
            Why is it significantly more difficult at the top of the movement than at the bottom?
            I don’t think there are exceptions. The hip thrust works the glutes because they
            stretch and contract while the weight offers a resistance. No, a bench press does not
            work the latissimus dorsi to a significant degree<sup><a href="https://www.scielo.br/j/motriz/a/jbfGfJrRsXbfc9BrfXgVSPy/?lang=en" target="_blank">10</a></sup> because even if there is movement,
            the weight does not offer a resistance to these muscles. I think that the hip thrust is
            more difficult at the top of the movement because the sarcomeres are shortened, so
            their capacity to generate force is lesser. Also, at the bottom of the movement, other
            muscles are in a good position to produce force. In other words, muscles like
            quadriceps and hamstring are able to help lift the weight<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6544005/" target="_blank">11</a></sup>
            , more so at the bottom of the movement.<sup><a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Fulltext/2018/03000/Electromyographic_Comparison_of_Barbell_Deadlift,.1.aspx" target="_blank">12</a></sup><br><br>
            <h3>Is friction useless?</h3>
            I think friction needs to be taken into account but I don’t think it influences the
            amount of tension on a specific muscle or muscle group.<br><br>
            Based on my finding, no matter the amount of friction, the amount of tension was in
            correlation with the distance perpendicular to the tension to the moving joints. Based
            on my understanding of other studies, friction could be used as a way to bias a
            muscle more than the other or to increase activation of a specific muscle.<br><br>
            Studies on mind muscle connection (MMC) are interesting for this. Even if MMC is
            supposedly an internal focus<sup><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323740477_Differential_effects_of_attentional_focus_strategies_during_long-term_resistance_training" target="_blank">13</a></sup>
            , the way to measure what MMC does is often to use
            actual internal focus (eg. “think about your pectoralis major” or “contract your
            pectoralis major” during bench press). Nonetheless, sometimes researchers will use
            external focus, different from “lift the weight from point A to B”, to examine MMC. A
            good example is a particular study<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6615069/" target="_blank">14</a></sup>
             where they asked participants to “attempt to
            bring your elbows to each other when you push” to work pectoralis major during
            bench press or “attempt to turn away your elbows from each other when you push”
            to work their triceps. Even if it is a way to make sure the subjects focused on the
            desired muscle, this technique will probably influence friction between the hands and
            the bar. The pectoralis major, for example, has to work during bench press because
            it contracts so horizontal humeral adduction happens. If you “bring your elbows to
            each other when you push”, it will increase friction between your hands and the bar.
            The pectoralis major will also contract independently of the necessary contraction to
            move the bar from A to B, it will increase its activation.<br><br>
            The reason why the SLD seems to work more the hamstring than the glutes
            compared with a RDL, even if knee flexion and range of motion are equated, is
            probably due to friction. There is an isometric contraction of the hamstring during the
            lift to counteract friction. So, even if the amount of tension, the length of the
            sarcomeres, and other metrics are equal, the hamstring will probably have higher
            activation (EMG) during a SLD than during a RDL. The hamstrings will be doing isometric
            contraction at the bottom of the movement to keep you stable and they will help
            extend your hips with your glutes to lift the weight.<br><br>
            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            There were a ton of limitations since it was not done in a lab. There is probably ~1%
            difference in the actual weight being lifted. I double checked the accuracy of the
            scale by weighing different weight plates. Every result was within 1% of the actual
            weight written on the plates. The distance between the bar and the hip joint was
            measured 2-3 times but I can’t guarantee that the distance is exact since the
            distance was not measured while the lift was being done. There was maybe a ± ¼
            inch difference between the distance used in the equation and the actual distance.
            Every test was only done once because of Covid-19 restrictions.<br><br>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            Even if the study was done outside of academia with a limited budget, I tried to be as
            precise as possible and when it was impossible I wrote it above. My goal is to inspire
            real professionals to do the work. Even if mechanotransduction seems to be the
            primary pathway of hypertrophy signaling within resistance training, the amount of
            tension is not yet used in studies. We need a big paradigm shift in hypertrophy
            research. If mechanical tension could be measured with accuracy, we would finally
            be able to say if an exercise is “better” than another with a similar <a href="https://samueleblanc.com/determining-a-mathematical-way-to-measure-resistance-profiles.html" target="_blank">resistance profile</a>
            and depending on the individual and their differences. We would also be able to have
            amazing science on resistance profiles and their application to training. EMG data is
            useful but it is currently used de facto, even if we know activation does not
            automatically mean hypertrophy.<sup><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286930702_Greater_Electromyographic_Responses_Do_Not_Imply_Greater_Motor_Unit_Recruitment_and_'Hypertrophic_Potential'_Cannot_Be_Inferred" target="_blank">15</a></sup><br><br>
            Based on my findings, the better way to calculate the amount of tension on a specific
            muscle is: “The weight” x “ The distance (from the moving joint to the tension in a
            straight line that is perpendicular to the tension)” which is also known as torque. Friction could be useful if we want
            to increase activation of a specific muscle.<br><br>
