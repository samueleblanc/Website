                N.B. Figures that require information are explained at the end.<br><br>
                Numerous methods are being used to interpret how much a muscle works during an
                exercise; like the force output (or torque) of a muscle and the electrical signal transmission
                (electromyography (EMG)) or <i>activation</i> of a muscle. However, measuring torque is often
                complicated, expensive and does not always fit the goal of the study. On the other hand,
                EMG is extremely popular but does not represent the amount of tension that is being applied
                on the muscle and we now know that more EMG does not mean more muscle hypertrophy<sup><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286930702_Greater_Electromyographic_Responses_Do_Not_Imply_Greater_Motor_Unit_Recruitment_and_'Hypertrophic_Potential'_Cannot_Be_Inferred" target="_blank">1</a></sup>
                and that applying tension is the primary hypertrophic stimulus within resistance training.<sup><a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Fulltext/2010/10000/The_Mechanisms_of_Muscle_Hypertrophy_and_Their.40.aspx" target="_blank">2</a></sup> The
                goal of this paper is to demonstrate mathematically how much tension* is being applied to a
                specific muscle, what is a resistance profile and what we can do to manipulate the
                resistance profile of an exercise without changing the exercise. Using an equation to do so
                would automatically increase our understanding of exercise mechanics, add resistance
                profile as a subjects of research, explain with accuracy and with a mathematical proof what
                is a resistance profile, increase the rigor and accuracy of resistance training studies, and
                reduce the need of a human interpretation when trying to find a conclusion, a causation or
                an explanation of a specific result.<br><br>
                <i>*The formula used is actually to measure power, not tension. We currently do not have the technology
                to deeply understand muscle architecture. Understanding the physics of the exercise therefore becomes 
                better suited for what we want. However, tension and power, in this case, are closely related.</i><br><br>
                <h3>Strength curves and resistance profiles</h3><img src="https://samueleblanc.com/Pictures/knee extension strenght curve.png" alt="Quadriceps strength curve" style="float: right; height: 30%; width: 30%; margin-left: 7px;">
                Strength curves have been subject to a lot of research.<sup><a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-essr/Citation/1984/01000/Human_Strength_Curves_.14.aspx" target="_blank">3</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1392571/" target="_blank">4</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1357553/" target="_blank">5</a>,<a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Abstract/1989/02000/Specificity_of_limited_range_of_motion_variable.15.aspx" target="_blank">6</a></sup>
                 Basically, it shows how much a
                muscle is able to produce force or torque depending on the sarcomere's length. Sarcomeres
                are the contractile unit of a muscle fiber, their length depends on the angle of a joint. The
                more you extend your knee, for example, the more you contract your muscle (i.e.
                quadriceps) therefore the more a sarcomere in a quadricep will shorten. In general, a muscle
                tends to produce significantly less torque if it is lengthened or shortened compared to its
                anatomical position. However, certain muscles, like the deltoid, are able to produce a lot of
                force when they're lengthened, but one thing is for sure, a muscle loses a lot of capacity to
                produce force as it's being contracted.<br><br>
                Strength curves are useful in our understanding of the musculoskeletal system and exercise
                mechanics, and can provide important information on how to program resistance training.
                They are nonetheless independent of the exercise one might be doing and of the resistance
                training approach you are choosing.<br><br>
                The resistance profile, on the other hand, is
                the resistance, measured as power, a
                particular exercise applies on a specific
                muscle. It is independent, but only to a
                certain point, of the strength curve of the
                muscle. Since velocity is involved, if
                someone contracts a muscle (i.e. changes
                the angle of a joint) faster or slower at some
                point of the movement due to an incapacity
                (or by choice) to produce a constant amount
                of force, the resistance profile will change.
                The tempo, which is a predetermined time
                for the different part of the movement
                (written 3110 for a 3 seconds eccentric, 1sec
                pause in the lengthened position, 1sec
                concentric and no pause in the shortened or
                fully contracted position†) influences the
                resistance profile by a lot. This has major
                implications if trying to compare two groups
                during a research. A group could, with or
                without knowing, execute an exercise faster
                or slower due to different cues given by the
                team of scientists present. It could probably
                happen in different studies on mind-muscle
                connection and range of motion (ROM) where participants are asked to think about a
                specific goal ("contract the muscle" or "don't go all the way down", for example). If the
                velocity changes, you can't compare both groups without taking—probably—a massive
                change in power into consideration. Trying to limit or measure changes in power can be
                quite difficult and expensive, when it's not the primary goal of a study. However, it would be
                extremely easy to enter a couple of simple metrics into an equation and it would
                automatically increase the rigor and accuracy of the study.<br><br>
                <i>†The eccentric portion of the movement is when the muscle lengthens or stretches, and the
                concentric portion is when it shortens or contracts.</i><br><br>
                <h3>The equation</h3>
                As of right now, the equation can only be applied in single joint movement if a dumbbell or
                barbell is being used. Upgrading the equation to be able to use it with cable and pulley
                based exercise will be quite easy. However, to more complex movements like squat and
                deadlift will be difficult and will need other studies to understand the role of friction. Based on
                my hypothesis, friction rarely impacts the tension that is being applied on a muscle<sup><a href="https://samueleblanc.com/determining-a-better-way-to-calculate-the-amount-of-tension-on-a-muscle-a-case-study-dark.html" target="_blank">7</a></sup> but it
                could impact the activation of a muscle.<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6615069/" target="_blank">8</a></sup> More studies are needed on that topic. It's
                fundamental to our understanding of exercise mechanics and it has major implications.<br><br><img src="https://samueleblanc.com/Pictures/power formula.png" alt="Power formula" style="float: left; height: 30%; width: 30%; margin-right: 7px;">
                <h3>Eccentric vs Concentric</h3>
                To use the equation, we need to separate the
                eccentric portion of the movement of the
                concentric portion. When using the equation,
                obviously we have to separate both parts of the
                movement because the velocity might be different,
                for example with a 3010 tempo. There is however
                a major difference between the two equations. For the eccentric portion of the movement,
                we need to use the percentage of the acceleration from gravity used to lower the weight
                instead of the angular velocity (ω). It's impossible to create acceleration during the eccentric
                portion unless you contract the antagonist muscle while fully relaxing the <i>working</i> muscle. It
                is however far from something someone should do. If someone does not try to "slow down"
                the weight during the eccentric, theoretically he uses 100% of the predefined (by gravity)
                velocity to reach the starting point (e.g. 0° of elbow flexion for a biceps curl). In that case,
                torque x 0 = 0 watt. Therefore there is absolutely no power produced if someone does not
                <i>control</i> the weight, which makes sense. It is also impossible to use 0% of the predefined
                velocity unless you don't move. It means that, except at the specific angle where you
                completely pause (if you do), a certain percentage of the predefined angular acceleration will
                be subtracted inversely proportionally to the velocity at which you perform the eccentric
                portion. In other words, the slower you go, during the eccentric portion, the more tension you
                apply on the specific muscle. It is however the inverse for the concentric portion, the bigger
                the velocity, the more power you produce.<br><br><img src="https://samueleblanc.com/Pictures/torque and force formula.png" alt="Torque and Force formula" style="float: right; height: 30%; width: 30%; margin-left: 7px;">
                To measure the distance between the weight
                and the moving joint, perpendicular to the
                tension (in that case gravity that acts on the
                weight), you simply need the length of the
                moving limb (e.g. forearm for a biceps curl) and
                the ROM. You theoretically use a specific angle,
                but I coded a program to measure resistance
                profile, for a ROM at every angle, to facilitate the
                use of the equation in different contexts (see later paragraphs). So, to measure the distance
                between the weight lifted and (perpendicular to) the moving joint, you can use the Law of
                Sines which, in that case, is the length of the moving limb x the sine of the angle at a
                specific point during the ROM / the sine of 90 (which is 1) because the distance is
                always perpendicular to the force, it's always 90°. Therefore, with the weight that you are
                using, the length of the moving limb, the ROM and the tempo, we can quite easily measure
                the resistance profile.<br><br>
                To measure the percentage to remove from the predefined acceleration (from gravity), you
                need to divide the velocity of the eccentric portion of the exercise by the velocity that you
                would get without resisting. In other words, the speed (rad/s) that would result from the
                totality of the acceleration from gravity. The calculation to get the velocity of the eccentric
                portion is extremely easy, but to get the "gravitational velocity", you need to use an elliptical
                integral.<sup><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253117973_The_nonlinear_pendulum_Formulas_for_the_large_amplitude_period" target="_blank">9</a></sup>
                 The simple pendulum formula doesn't work due to its inaccuracy when the angle
                gets too big. Anyhow, using the elliptical integral or an approximation of it results in a close
                enough estimation of the period.<sup><a href="https://aapt.scitation.org/doi/10.1119/1.14703" target="_blank">10</a>,<a href="https://oeis.org/A223068" target="_blank">11</a></sup>
                 The period is the time used for the pendulum to return
                to its original position. To get the velocity, you simply have to divide the range of motion in
                radians by the period <i>used</i>. So, if you did a 3sec eccentric when the gravitational
                acceleration was supposed to lead to a 1sec eccentric, you can determine that you used 1/3
                of the predefined acceleration, therefore you need to subtract ~33% of it.<br><br>
                <h3>The use of inertia and momentum during an exercise</h3>
                Something that we often see within resistance training is the intentional use of an increase in
                momentum, often paired with an increase in inertia. I however tend to recommend an
                increase in momentum paired with a decrease in inertia. If, obviously, it is in line with the
                goal of the athlete.<br><br>
                First, momentum is the mass of an object x its velocity, so it is impossible to not have
                momentum while performing an exercise. What most people do, is that they use their body
                to create velocity and, due to the law of conservation of momentum, they will only need to
                produce a minimal amount of contractile force with the specific muscle they want to train to
                finish the movement. For instance, someone will use their lower body musculature to start a
                (<i>deltoid</i>) lateral raise. One might also simply create a lot of force at the beginning of the
                movement and let the law of conservation of momentum do most of the rest of the job, but
                let me get back to that.<br><br>
                The problem is that most people do it for the wrong reasons and while using a specific type
                of exercise. The most common reason is simply to lift more weight. It's possible to argue that
                using more velocity and more weight is a good idea because, based on the equation, you
                would get more power. However, there is a problem with that reasoning. The formula works if
                you have to produce contractile force, you can't, for instance, throw a weight in the air and
                say that its mass and velocity are still applying tension on your muscle. Let me repeat: the
                formula works if you have to produce contractile force.<br><br>
                If you produce a constant amount of force to keep the velocity stable during the movement,
                velocity will be used as a constant and only the distance between the weight and the joint
                will change the power. Just as an example, let's analyze (<i>see below</i>) the different
                possibilities of a DB lateral raise, a popular exercise for the medial deltoid. Each scenario is
                using someone with a shoulder to hand length of 70 cm and a DB of 15 kg. Scenario 1 is a
                standard DB lateral raise with a 1 second concentric and a constant velocity. Scenario 2 is
                someone who lifts the weight twice as fast for the first half of the exercise and he then uses
                momentum to not produce any force for the rest of the movement. When comparing those
                two scenarios, we can see that he reaches a higher amount of power than scenario one.
                However, if someone can, with the same weight, create that much velocity, I would probably
                suggest taking heavier dumbbells and using a more complete range of motion, making the
                comparison between the two scenarios impossible. What actually happens most of the time,
                is someone generate the most force possible through the muscle he wants to train and uses
                his body to generate the rest of the momentum, therefore creating a scenario like the third
                one; (a) there is only power in the part of the movement where his deltoids are working and
                (b) his deltoids can't create more contractile force than they could in the first scenario.<br><br>
                <img src="https://samueleblanc.com/Pictures/3 scenarios for a DB lateral raise.png" alt="Lateral raise res profile" style="height: 85%; width: 85%;" class="center"><br>
                <img src="https://samueleblanc.com/Pictures/BB preacher curl 1 sec concentric.png" alt="Preacher curl res profile" style="float: right; height: 30%; width: 30%; margin-left: 7px;">
                Those scenarios can not be used to explain
                every exercise in which you start with a larger
                acceleration, because a DB lateral raise is part
                of the group of exercises that I referenced earlier.
                Why is it the type of exercise that is commonly
                used for this type of behavior? Because inertia
                increases as the exercise is performed. Inertia,
                which increases due to an increase in the
                distance between the joint and the force (gravity
                on the DB), determines the object's resistance in
                a change in motion, while momentum
                determines the amount of motion. So, the more
                momentum <i>and</i> inertia you have, the less force you have to produce to keep lifting the
                weight. If you take an exercise that has a lot of power while your muscle is in its lengthened
                position and it keeps lowering while you lift the weight (i.e. while you contract your muscle),
                you would theoretically need to keep producing force because the object's resistance in
                change of motion would be really low. In other words, the effect of gravity will soon make the
                weight stop moving and you'll have to lift it with the help of your muscle. For instance, doing
                so in a Preacher curl would be less problematic in terms of losing tension at the end of the
                movement, simply because you have less inertia at the end of the movement compared with
                the start.<br><br>
                <h3>The eccentric portion</h3>
                Contrary to the concentric portion, the velocity is inversely proportional to the power for the
                eccentric part of the exercise. Meaning that the slower you go, the more power you get.
                However, the difference after a certain point is quite small. We can clearly see, from the
                graphics below this paragraph, that if you only‡ change the eccentric velocity, the difference
                between a 1sec to 2sec eccentric is similar to a 2sec to 5sec eccentric. Obviously, a
                difference of a couple percent at every repetition can lead to major results, but even going
                from not resisting the eccentric at all to offering a slightly significant resistance can benefit
                greatly.<br><br><img src="https://samueleblanc.com/Pictures/DB biceps curl 1 2 5 sec eccentric.png" class="center" alt="Biceps curl eccentric" style="height: 85%; width: 85%;"><br>
                <i><scan class="center">‡ Each scenario is using a 0° to 120° ROM, 15kg dumbbells, and 35cm forearms.</scan></i><br><br>
                Another important significance in understanding the impact of velocity in resistance profiles,
                is understanding how to prioritize a specific part of the movement. Below this paragraph, you
                can easily see how a change in tempo can lead to an increase—or decrease—in power
                during the eccentric or concentric portion. During the last one or two decades, there has
                been an increasing interest in comparing both parts of an exercise, to better understand their
                specific benefits.<sup><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23448419_The_effects_of_eccentric_versus_concentric_resistance_training_on_muscle_strength_and_mass_in_healthy_adults_A_systematic_review_with_meta-analysis" target="_blank">12</a>,<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259585622_Architectural_functional_and_molecular_responses_to_concentric_and_eccentric_loading_in_human_skeletal_muscle" target="_blank">13</a></sup>
                 To prioritize the concentric portion, you need to perform the eccentric
                and the concentric relatively fast. Inversely, to prioritize the eccentric portion, you
                theoretically need to do both slowly. However, doing so would result in a massive increase in
                time under tension (TUT) during a period of high metabolic demand, therefore leading to an
                increase in metabolic stress, which is what prioritizing the concentric portion leads to.<sup><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310474766_Moderate_Load_Eccentric_Exercise_A_Distinct_Novel_Training_Modality" target="_blank">14</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6950543/" target="_blank">15</a></sup>
                Nevertheless, in most cases, I think that voluntarily performing the concentric slowly is not
                the best idea. The concentric <i>will</i> slow down if you reach proximity to failure, in that case,
                you will recruit high threshold motor units, leading to more hypertrophy.<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4731492/" target="_blank">16</a>,<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331718773_Does_Training_to_Failure_Maximize_Muscle_Hypertrophy" target="_blank">17</a></sup> That is why I
                would recommend a training partner if the goal is to make the eccentric portion the main
                focus.<br><br><img src="https://samueleblanc.com/Pictures/DB biceps curl various tempo.png" alt="Biceps curl tempo" class="center" style="width: 85%; height: 85%;"><br>
                <h3>Linking strength curves and resistance profiles</h3><img src="https://samueleblanc.com/Pictures/resistance profile vs strength curve.png" alt="Resistance profile and strength curve" style="float: right; height: 45%; width: 45%; margin-left: 7px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
                An increasingly popular belief is that "resistance profiles should (or must) be similar to the
                strength curve". I want to provide information as to why I do not think of it as a good
                ideology. But, before laying potential reasons, I want to explain the reasoning behind the
                ideology—which is not necessarily completely wrong. Certain coaches or trainers
                recommend to select
                exercise that has a
                resistance profile similar to
                the strength curve of the
                muscle that is being
                trained because that is a
                perfect scenario to be able
                to generate the maximal
                amount of force, therefore
                producing high mechanical
                tension (or stress), which
                seems to be the primary
                stimulus for muscle hypertrophy within resistance training.<sup><a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Fulltext/2010/10000/The_Mechanisms_of_Muscle_Hypertrophy_and_Their.40.aspx" target="_blank">2</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6950543/" target="_blank">15</a>,<a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00685.2018?rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org" target="_blank">18</a>,<a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physiol.00041.2007?rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org" target="_blank">19</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6771594/" target="_blank">20</a>,<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266084792_A_Review_on_the_Mechanisms_of_Blood-Flow_Restriction_Resistance_Training-Induced_Muscle_Hypertrophy" target="_blank">21</a></sup>
                Because, you could,
                in that case, use a weight that is maximally challenging during the entirety of the movement.
                The power would be at its highest when your muscle is able to produce the most contractile
                force possible and the power would lower while the muscle would weaken. For instance, we
                could say that "the resistance profile of a BB preacher curl (using a preacher bench with a
                40° angle) matches the strength curve of the biceps (or elbow flexors)". I however find it
                difficult to say, based on this statement, that the preacher curl is automatically one of the
                best exercises for the biceps.<br><br>
                There are two major reasons why I tend to object to this statement. First, I think that
                choosing various exercises with different resistance profiles is a good idea in the long term.
                There seems to be an advantage in prioritizing the shortened position if you specifically want
                to hypertrophy the medial part of a muscle.<sup><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236581117_Impact_of_Range_of_Motion_During_Ecologically_Valid_Resistance_Training_Protocols_on_Muscle_Size_Subcutaneous_Fat_and_Strength" target="_blank">22</a></sup>
                 Also, I would hypothesize that having a
                resistance profile that challenges the shortened position, when the muscle is at its weakest,
                would increase metabolic stress to a significant level, because being able to generate
                enough contractile force would be quite metabolically demanding. Contrarily, choosing an
                exercise that almost exclusively has power when the muscle has the largest capacity to
                generate force would be a lot less metabolically demanding, therefore serving different
                purposes. We know that periodized training tends to be better for muscle hypertrophy and
                strength,<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6351492/" target="_blank">23</a>,<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28497285/" target="_blank">24</a></sup>
                 and I think that including resistance profile in our periodization could be even
                more beneficial in terms of stimulus variation and specificity, and even for the simple benefits
                of the increase in motivation with exercise variety.<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6934277/" target="_blank">25</a></sup><br><br>
                <img src="https://samueleblanc.com/Pictures/Sarcomeres before and after RT.png" alt="Sarcomeres angle" style="float: left; height: 37%; width: 37%; margin-right: 7px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
                Secondly, I would argue that the
                strength curve of a muscle might
                differ with an increase in fatigue and
                a change in muscle architecture due
                to a resistance training protocol. We
                know that sarcomeres, the
                contractile units of the muscle fibers,
                undergo a slow change in angle
                during a workout (figure to the left).<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5495834/" target="_blank">26</a></sup>
                We do not know for sure if it impacts the strength curve, but it would be surprising if the
                change in angle would not modify the capacity to generate contractile force. Nevertheless, I
                could also argue that with metabolite accumulation, an hypoxic environment, and lower
                energy availability, it would be astonishing that one is still able to produce a proportional
                amount of contractile force in the shortened position compared with the lengthened position,
                like prior to the workout. Therefore, suggesting that one must choose exercises that
                "matches" the resistance profile is most likely a bad idea. I would tend to suggest choosing
                an exercise with a resistance profile that "matches" the goal stimulus.<br><br>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                In conclusion, I think that a fundamental understanding in exercise mechanics could help
                coaches and trainers make better decisions for their clients and athletes. I also think that it
                could help scientists gain important knowledge that could be applied in increasing the rigor
                and the accuracy of future studies. Mechanical stress has an essential role in muscle
                hypertrophy and we currently have no serious understanding of the underlying physics of it.
                Being able to make mathematical predictions would revolutionize resistance training science.
                If you want to get the program (code) that I used to calculate the resistance profiles, you can
                copy it from the PDF below and paste it in Python. Please remember that (as of right now) it
                can't use every exercise, only those with one rotating joint, and that use a dumbbell or a
                barbell.<br><br>

            <h3>Current limitations</h3>
            As of right now, there are a couple limitations concerning the practicality and efficacy of the
            equation:<br>
            1. If there's a lack of control for the changes in directions (between the eccentric and
            concentric, and vise-versa), the lost in power is currently not accounted for;<br>
            2. The current equation does not support the use of cable and pulley systems, nor does
            it support the use of multi-joint—or full-body— exercises;<br>
            3. The amount of power lost when the tension is not in line with the primary muscle is
            currently not known.§<br><br>
            <i>§ Another major lack of understanding is regarding factors that determines which muscle
            receives most—if possible all—of the tension. Some people, myself included, would say that
            you need (a) the power directed in a way that increases tension, not compression, and (b)
            that the power is lined up with the aimed muscle fibers. Therefore, the future formula must
            take into consideration a <a href="https://samueleblanc.com/resistance-training-as-a-newtonian-4d-model-dark.html" target="_blank">4D model</a> of the exercise: (1) Is the force increasing tension? (2) Is
            the force in line with the aimed muscle? (this dimension is the one that the formula is
            lacking) (3) This is where you add the angle of the moving joint, the distance (radius), etc.
            and finally (4) you must add velocity.</i><br><br>

            angle, and Force = Mass x Acceleration (gravity);<br>
