        <p0>The goal of this website is to share ideas on how to solve resistance training with the help of physics
            and artificial intelligence. After understanding the underlying mathematics of exercise mechanics
            and its attached stimulus, using computers to help with program and even study desing will be possible.<br>

            This website was created to put my ideas about the future of resistance training science

            <p><h2>Is there a place for philosophy in resistance training?</h2>
                <p>Philosophy is known to be something like “the study of the fundamental 
                    nature of reality”. I however think it is becoming less true with time. 
                    Before the scientific revolution, every question was a... <a href="https://samueleblanc.com/is-there-a-place-for-philosophy-in-resistance-training.html">Read more</a><br><br><span class="greyText">2021-08-24</span></p></p><br>
        <p><h2>A 4D model of training in relationship with a 5D model of personality</h2><p>
            Most personal trainers and coaches will adjust the resistance training program based on 
            their clients preference. It will most likely be done through asking questions and through 
            trial and error... <a href="https://samueleblanc.com/a-4d-model-of-training-in-relationship-with-a-5d-model-of-personality.html">Read more</a><br><br><span class="greyText">2021-08-23</span></p></p><br>
            <h2>Training stimulus is a number between 0 and 1</h2>
            <p>Resistance training can be understood with Newtonian physics, therefore making it possible to 
                compute its main stimulus. There are different approach on how to divide training stimuli. 
                The one that's most... <a href="https://samueleblanc.com/training-stimulus-is-a-number-between-0-and-1.html">Read more</a><br><br><span class="greyText">2021-08-09</span></p></p1><br>
            <p2><h2>Resistance training as a Newtonian 4D model</h2>
            <p>To understand exercise mechanics and therefore further understand resistance training science, 
                we need a fundamental shift in the way we see training. Without removing EMG and long term studies, 
                simply adding... <a href="https://samueleblanc.com/resistance-training-as-a-newtonian-4d-model.html">Read more</a><br><br><span class="greyText">2021-08-01</span></p></p2><br>
            <p3><h2>Determining a mathematical way to measure resistance profiles</h2>
            <p>Numerous methods are being used to interpret how much a muscle works during an
                exercise; like the force output (or torque) of a muscle and the electrical signal transmission
                (electromyography (EMG)) or activation of a muscle. However, measuring...

            <p>The purpose of this unofficial review is to hopefully shed some light on various
                misunderstandings concerning range of motion (ROM) and its application. There are

            <p5><h2>Determining a better way to calculate the amount of tension on a muscle: A case study</h2>
            <p>This unofficial case study tried to find a better approach to measure how much
                tension is being applied to a muscle. There are currently two ways to measure the
                quantity of mechanical tension on a muscle... <a href="https://samueleblanc.com/determining-a-better-way-to-calculate-the-amount-of-tension-on-a-muscle-a-case-study.html">Read more</a><br><br><span class="greyText">2020-12-27</span></p></p5></div><br><br><br>
