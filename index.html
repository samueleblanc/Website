        <p0>The goal of this website is to share ideas on how to solve resistance training with the help of physics
            and artificial intelligence. After understanding the underlying mathematics of exercise mechanics
            and its attached stimulus, using computers to help with program and even study desing will be possible.</p0><br><br>

            <h2>Training stimulus is a number between 0 and 1</h2>
            <p>Resistance training can be understood with Newtonian physics, therefore making <br>it possible to 
                compute its main stimulus. There are different approach on how to <br>divide training stimuli.

            <p>To understand exercise mechanics and therefore further understand resistance <br>training science, 
                we need a fundamental shift in the way we see training. <br>Without removing EMG and long term studies,

            <p>Numerous methods are being used to interpret how much a muscle works <br>during an
                exercise; like the force output (or torque) of a muscle and the <br>electrical signal transmission
                (electromyography (EMG)) or activation <br>of a muscle. However, measuring...
