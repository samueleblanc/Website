        <p>This website was created to put my ideas about the future of resistance training science and technology on a single platform.<br><br>

Making an inexpensive and skilled virtual trainer will be good for science and for everyday life application. To do so, 
it is necessary to link exercise mechanics, training stimulus, periodization, personality traits and the role of muscle 
architecture in training. This website talks about all of them except the latter. To read more on it, I recommend <a href="https://www.cell.com/biophysj/fulltext/S0006-3495(21)00609-3#%20" target="_blank">this 
article<sup>1</sup></a>. It is a deep dive of the mathematics underlying sarcomeres, the contracting units of a muscle. Why mathematics 
instead of the usual biochemistry? Because, to make resistance training entirely computable, a lower level of abstraction 
is often more useful. This is why this website revolves around mathematics and physics.<br><br>

My goal, with the necessary help of others, is to create that system. Most of my thoughts are expressed as articles on 
the website (the article’s order is from the most recently written to the oldest).<br>
