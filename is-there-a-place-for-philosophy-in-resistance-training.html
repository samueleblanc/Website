        Philosophy is known to be something like “the study of the fundamental nature of reality”. 
        I however think it is becoming less true with time. Before the scientific revolution, every 
        question was a philosophical one. “Why is the sky blue?”, which could be said to be a childish 
        — and false — way of representing philosophy, was actually a philosophical question for 
        thousands of years. Since then, scientific studies, in this case physics, told us that it 
        could be explained without the use of a god, or anything other than simple interaction between 
        particles.* Since the scientific revolution, philosophy has been elevated to be what science 
        can’t yet answer.<br><br>

        We divided scientific fields because of our low memory capacity. It is impossible for us to 
        <a href="https://samueleblanc.com/a-4d-model-of-training-in-relationship-with-a-5d-model-of-personality.html" target="_blank">explain psychology with physics</a>, we needed to create levels of abstraction, so that some things 
        could be generalised easier while some things can stay extremely specific. It also enables us, 
        for instance, to acquire scientific knowledge while observing nature (ie. biology) instead of 
        running a program from the <i>source code</i> of the universe to the emergence of that particular 
        behavior of that species, different fields were created through a form of data compression.<br><br>
        
        Everything is therefore based on prediction (except mathematics, which was created to be 
        true by default). That’s why using Newtonian physics to describe exercise mechanics is 
        better than quantum physics. Both don't operate at the same distance from the source code, 
        but it doesn’t mean that one is <i>true</i> and the other is not. Both are predictions that are 
        accurate depending on what it tries to predict. Physics as the truth, not as a prediction 
        model, might never be found if the current physics emerged from an older set of rules.<br><br>
        
        <i>* Particles in the atmosphere deviate light particles (photons). Since the deviation by 
        the atmosphere is higher with shorter wavelengths, we see the sky blue (it has the shortest 
        wavelength of the visible lights).</i><br>
        
        <h3>Back to philosophy</h3>
        
        There are multiple fields that can explain things about the human body, all of which make 
        predictions at a different level. Currently; physics, chemistry, biology, 
        psychology and philosophy can all give answers to some important questions, but different 
        ones. For example, you can’t even begin to answer “Is suffering fundamental to human 
        existence?” with anything below biology in terms of abstraction. On the other hand, like 
        said earlier, “Why is the sky blue?” is now strictly a question for physics.<br><br>
        
        Regarding resistance training, pioneers like Joe Weider, who was Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 
        mentor, were using philosophy to make recommendations. It was, at the time, the best tool 
        to make predictions. Claims about muscle hypertrophy methods like “it’s best to constantly 
        change your workout so that you confuse your muscles” and “have your spotter making you do 
        forced repetitions to go beyond failure” turned out to be wrong or ineffective.<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3588896/" target="_blank">1</a>,<a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-scj/fulltext/2015/10000/a_brief_review_of_forced_repetitions_for_the.3.aspx" target="_blank">2</a></sup> With time, 
        philosophy has been elevated to be what science can’t yet answer. So, is there still a place 
        for philosophy in resistance training?<br>
        
        <h3>Philosophy in resistance training</h3>
        
        Currently, biochemistry, biology and psychology are what’s used to answer training 
        related questions. Biochemistry is the main one, because it describes what happens in 
        the body at the lowest level of abstraction possible as of right now. Biology explains 
        the principle of muscle and nervous system adapting to a stimulus, leading to muscle 
        hypertrophy or strength increases. Psychology explains the benefits of resistance training 
        for mental health, but also advice on how to stay motivated, for example. Finally, my obvious 
        goal with this website is to share ideas on how to answer resistance training questions with 
        physics, making it computable and creating various opportunities for improvement and 
        technology advancement.<br><br>
        
        I however do not think that philosophy is rendered useless regarding weight training. 
        Some examples of questions that need to be asked, first from a philosophical perspective 
        and then possibly answered through another field are “Should you allow yourself 
        to skip a workout?”, “Where should training be in your hierarchy of priorities?” and “Is it 
        okay for a personal trainer or coach to oversimplify an explanation to help the client?”. 
        Answering, or at least discussing these questions is essential for creating the optimal 
        training plan. We, as humans, might be able to make adequate judgments, depending on the 
        situation, without knowing why. However, questioning our fundamental reasoning is a must 
        because (a) someone who makes a decision without being able to explain why has no reason 
        to think it was a wise one, and (b) an artificial intelligence system doesn’t come with 
        innate intuition, hence it is necessary for us to program an appropriate reasoning to 
        make a good virtual trainer.<br>
