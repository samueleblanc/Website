        MatTalX uses, most of the time, the same command as LaTeX. Some important differences are, for instance, ℝ is \mathbbR in MatTalX, instead of \mathbb{R} in LaTex. The same goes for 𝑹 
        (and every other letters), which is obtained with \mathbfR instead of \mathbf{R}. However, for 𝑥̅, 𝑦̂ and 𝑧̲, MatTalX uses x \overline, y \hat and z \underline as commands, instead of \overline{x}, 
        \hat{y} and \underline{z}.
        <br><br>
        Another important change from LaTex is that you can’t “build” a symbol in MatTalX. As an example, ≝ is simply \def in MatTalX, but \stackrel{\rm def}{=} in LaTex. As a last example, 
        ∛2 is \sqrt3 2 instead of \sqrt[3]{2}.
        <br><br>
        For fractions, since MatTalX renders symbol in UTF format, it is recommended to represent f(x) divided by g(x) as 𝑓(𝑥) ∕ 𝑔(𝑥) or 𝑓(𝑥)(𝑔(𝑥))⁻¹. If it is a simple fraction (like one half), you can use \frac1/2 → ½, 
        but it won’t work for every fraction (see page 9 in PDF). It is however possible to build your own fraction with ^1 / _2 → ¹∕₂. <br><br><br>
