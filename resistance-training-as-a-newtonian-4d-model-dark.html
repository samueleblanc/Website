            To understand exercise mechanics and therefore further understand resistance 
            training science, we need a fundamental shift in the way we see training.
             Without removing EMG and long term studies, simply adding different technologies 
             to increase our ability to predict changes in outcome, based on changes in 
             exercise mechanics and training programming would definitely help us adding 
             rigor to training studies.<br><br>
            To do so, a deep understanding of the physics of exercise is needed. With that
             knowledge, creating new technologies to help humans with their bias make data 
             more accurate would be possible. For instance, a subtle change in the angle 
             between the force arrow of the barbell and the targeted muscle can radically 
             change the efficacy of the particular exercise.<br>
            <h3>Four dimensions</h3>
            The first dimension is the arrow (with its direction) of the force that acts on 
            the weight or machine. This concept explains why a bench press mainly targets 
            the pectoralis muscle, while the exact same set-up, but with a cable pulling in 
            the other direction (ie. cable row) targets the back musculature. The second 
            dimension, like reported earlier, is the angle between the targeted muscle and 
            the force arrow. Changes in that dimension changes (a) which muscle is being 
            targeted. A small change in the angle between the humerus and the body can 
            potentially change if the rear deltoid, the upper trapezius or the lat is the 
            primary working muscle. (b) In the same manner, it can change the part of the 
            muscle that is being targeted the most, for example the clavicular or costal 
            part of the pectoralis major. Finally, (c) it can change the efficacy of an 
            exercise, by decreasing the force that should act on that muscle, and placing 
            some of it on joints or other muscles. If someone is doing DB biceps curl with 
            10kg, but there is a 20° angle between the humerus and a straight line (force 
            vector) perpendicular to the floor, the force being applied in a direction that
             increases the probability that the nervous system will favor the desired muscle
              in contracting is ~40 N (10 x 9.8 x cos(20)) compared with 98 N if the humerus
               would have been perpendicular to the floor.* We can see this having an effect 
               in a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31034463/" target="_blank">study</a> on different ranges of motion, potentially due to a lack of mobility.<sup>†</sup> 
               The third and fourth dimensions 
               are what is called the resistance profile. Basically, it is the power of an 
               exercise (torque x angular velocity) at every angle.<sup>‡</sup> The second part of the
                time dimension is the time spent in certain parts of the movement. Doing an 
                isometric contraction at the end of the biceps curl will not change the 
                resistance profile of the exercise, but it can change the outcome in terms
                 of <!--<a href="https://samueleblanc.com/training-stimulus-is-a-number-between-0-and-1-dark.html" target="_blank"></a>-->stimulus.<br><br>

            <h3>The role of technology</h3>
            Technology could <i>easily</i> be used to monitor changes in exercise mechanics, 
            using data from videos or other instruments. It would be extremely useful to assess 
            the difference between individuals and the way a movement is performed. It could help 
            scientists by providing more rigorous and accurate data. Also, it could potentially 
            help thousands of individuals in the practice of safe, thought through training regiment — 
            if the technology is cheap and easy to use.</div></p><br><br>
