                <b>Important:</b> I used to define the resistance profile as the power for each angle. I now represent it as 
            torque for each angle, and am looking for a new way to take angular velocity into consideration. It will most likely 
            manifest itself closer to the physics of the motor unit, not of the exercise.<br><br><br>

            Numerous methods are being used to interpret how much a muscle works during an
            exercise; like the force output, torque or work, and the electrical signal transmission
            (electromyography (EMG)) or <i>activation</i> of a muscle. However, measuring force, torque, work or power with 
            equipments like a linear position transducter, a goniometer, etc. is often
            complicated, expensive and does not always fit the goal of the study. On the other hand,
            EMG is extremely popular but does not represent the amount of tension that is being applied
            on the muscle and we now know that more EMG does not mean more muscle hypertrophy<sup><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286930702_Greater_Electromyographic_Responses_Do_Not_Imply_Greater_Motor_Unit_Recruitment_and_'Hypertrophic_Potential'_Cannot_Be_Inferred" target="_blank">1</a></sup>
            and that applying tension is the primary hypertrophic stimulus within resistance training.<sup><a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Fulltext/2010/10000/The_Mechanisms_of_Muscle_Hypertrophy_and_Their.40.aspx" target="_blank">2</a></sup> The
            goal of this article is talk about power and its role in exercise mechanics, what is a resistance profile and what we can do to 
            manipulate it without changing the exercise. Using a simple equation, that could be calculated using data from a video, to do so
            would automatically increase our understanding of exercise mechanics, add resistance
            profile as a subjects of research, explain with accuracy what
            is a resistance profile, increase the rigor and accuracy of resistance training studies, and
            reduce the need of a human interpretation when trying to find a conclusion, a causation or
            an explanation of a specific result.<br><br>
            <h3>Strength curves and resistance profiles</h3><img src="https://samueleblanc.com/Pictures/knee extension strenght curve.png" alt="Quadriceps strength curve" id="pic30" style="float: right; margin-left: 7px;">
            Strength curves have been subject to a lot of research.<sup><a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-essr/Citation/1984/01000/Human_Strength_Curves_.14.aspx" target="_blank">3</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1392571/" target="_blank">4</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1357553/" target="_blank">5</a>,<a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Abstract/1989/02000/Specificity_of_limited_range_of_motion_variable.15.aspx" target="_blank">6</a></sup>
             Basically, it shows how much a
            muscle is able to produce force or torque depending on the sarcomere's length. Sarcomeres
            are the contractile unit of a muscle fiber, their length depends on the angle of a joint. The
            more you extend your knee, for example, the more you contract your muscle (i.e.
            quadriceps) therefore the more a sarcomere in a quadricep will shorten. In general, a muscle
            tends to produce significantly less torque if it is lengthened or shortened compared to its
            anatomical position. However, certain muscles, like the deltoid, are able to produce a lot of
            force when they're lengthened, but one thing is for sure, a muscle loses a lot of capacity to
            produce force as it's being contracted.<br><br>
            Strength curves are useful in our understanding of the musculoskeletal system and exercise
            mechanics, and can provide important information on how to program resistance training.
            They are nonetheless independent of the exercise one might be doing and of the resistance
            training approach you are choosing.<br><br>
            The resistance profile, on the other hand, is
            the resistance, measured as power, of a
            particular exercise applies on a specific
            muscle. It is independent, but only to a
            certain point, of the strength curve of the
            muscle. Since velocity is involved, if
            someone contracts a muscle (i.e. changes
            the angle of a joint) faster or slower at some
            point of the movement due to an incapacity
            (or by choice) to produce a constant amount
            of force, the resistance profile will change.
            The tempo, which is a predetermined time
            for the different part of the movement
            (written 3110 for a 3 seconds eccentric, 1sec
            pause in the lengthened position, 1sec
            concentric and no pause in the shortened or
            fully contracted position‚Ä†) influences the
            resistance profile by a lot. This has major
            implications if trying to compare two groups
            during a research. A group could, with or
            without knowing, execute an exercise faster
            or slower due to different cues given by the
            team of scientists present. It could probably
            happen in different studies on mind-muscle
            connection and range of motion (ROM) where participants are asked to think about a
            specific goal ("contract the muscle" or "don't go all the way down", for example). If the
            velocity changes, you can't compare both groups without taking‚Äîprobably‚Äîa massive
            change in power into consideration. Trying to limit or measure changes in power can be
            quite difficult and expensive, when it's not the primary goal of a study. However, it would be
            extremely easy to enter a couple of simple metrics into an equation and it would
            automatically increase the rigor and accuracy of the study.<br><br>
            <i>‚Ä†The eccentric portion of the movement is when the muscle lengthens or stretches, and the
            concentric portion is when it shortens or contracts.</i><br><br>
            <h3>Eccentric vs Concentric</h3>
            <img src="https://samueleblanc.com/Pictures/power formula.png" alt="Power formula" id="pic30" style="float: left; margin-right: 7px;">
            To use the equation, we need to separate the
            eccentric portion of the movement of the
            concentric portion. When using the equation,
            obviously we have to separate both parts of the
            movement because the velocity might be different,
            for example with a 3010 tempo. There is however
            a major difference between the two equations. For the eccentric portion of the movement,
            we need to use the percentage of the acceleration from gravity used to lower the weight
            instead of the angular velocity (ùúî). It's impossible to create acceleration during the eccentric
            portion unless you contract the antagonist muscle while fully relaxing the <i>working</i> muscle. It
            is however far from something someone should do. If someone does not try to "slow down"
            the weight during the eccentric, theoretically he uses 100% of the predefined (by gravity)
            velocity to reach the starting point (e.g. 0¬∞ of elbow flexion for a biceps curl). In that case,
            torque x 0 = 0 watt. Therefore there is absolutely no power produced if someone does not
            <i>control</i> the weight, which makes sense. It is also impossible to use 0% of the predefined
            velocity unless you don't move. It means that, except at the specific angle where you
            completely pause (if you do), a certain percentage of the predefined angular acceleration will
            be subtracted inversely proportionally to the velocity at which you perform the eccentric
            portion. In other words, the slower you go, during the eccentric portion, the more tension you
            apply on the specific muscle. It is however the inverse for the concentric portion, the bigger
            the velocity, the more power you produce.<br><br><img src="https://samueleblanc.com/Pictures/torque and force formula.png" alt="Torque and Force formula" id="pic30" style="float: right; margin-left: 7px;">
            To measure the distance between the weight
            and the moving joint, perpendicular to the
            tension (in that case gravity that acts on the
            weight), you simply need the length of the
            moving limb (e.g. forearm for a biceps curl) and
            the ROM. You theoretically use a specific angle,
            but I coded a program to measure resistance
            profile, for a ROM at every angle, to facilitate the
            use of the equation in different contexts (see later paragraphs). So, to measure the distance
            between the weight lifted and (perpendicular to) the moving joint, you can use the Law of
            Sines which, in that case, is the length of the moving limb x sine of the angle at a
            specific point during the ROM / sin90¬∞ (which is 1) because the distance is
            always perpendicular to the force, it's always 90¬∞. Therefore, with the weight that you are
            using, the length of the moving limb, the ROM and the tempo, we can quite easily measure
            the resistance profile.<br><br>
            To measure the percentage to remove from the predefined acceleration (from gravity), you
            need to divide the velocity of the eccentric portion of the exercise by the velocity that you
            would get without resisting. In other words, the speed (rad/s) that would result from the
            totality of the acceleration from gravity. The calculation to get the velocity of the eccentric
            portion is extremely easy, but to get the "gravitational velocity", you need to use an elliptical
            integral.<sup><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253117973_The_nonlinear_pendulum_Formulas_for_the_large_amplitude_period" target="_blank">9</a></sup>
             The simple pendulum formula doesn't work due to its inaccuracy when the angle
            gets too big. Anyhow, using the elliptical integral or an approximation of it results in a close
            enough estimation of the period.<sup><a href="https://aapt.scitation.org/doi/10.1119/1.14703" target="_blank">10</a>,<a href="https://oeis.org/A223068" target="_blank">11</a></sup>
             The period is the time used for the pendulum to return
            to its original position. To get the velocity, you simply have to divide the range of motion in
            radians by the period <i>used</i>. So, if you did a 3sec eccentric when the gravitational
            acceleration was supposed to lead to a 1sec eccentric, you can determine that you used 1/3
            of the predefined acceleration, therefore you need to subtract ~33% of it.<br><br>
            <h3>The use of inertia and momentum during an exercise</h3>
            Something that we often see within resistance training is the intentional use of an increase in
            momentum, often paired with an increase in inertia. I however tend to recommend an
            increase in momentum paired with a decrease in inertia. If, obviously, it is in line with the
            goal of the athlete.<br><br>
            First, momentum is the mass of an object x its velocity (ùëù = ùëöùë£), so it is impossible to not have
            momentum while performing an exercise. What most people do, is that they use their body
            to create velocity and, due to the law of conservation of momentum, they will only need to
            produce a minimal amount of contractile force with the specific muscle they want to train to
            finish the movement. For instance, someone will use their lower body musculature to start a
            (<i>deltoid</i>) lateral raise. One might also simply create a lot of force at the beginning of the
            movement and let the law of conservation of momentum do most of the rest of the job, but
            let me get back to that.<br><br>
            The problem is that most people do it for the wrong reasons and while using a specific type
            of exercise. The most common reason is simply to lift more weight. It's possible to argue that
            using more velocity and more weight is a good idea because, based on the equation, you
            would get more power. However, there is a problem with that reasoning. The formula works if
            you have to produce contractile force, you can't, for instance, throw a weight in the air and
            say that its mass and velocity are still applying tension on your muscle. Let me repeat: the
            formula works if you have to produce contractile force.<br><br>
            If you produce a constant amount of force to keep the velocity stable during the movement,
            velocity will be used as a constant and only the distance between the weight and the joint
            will change the power. Just as an example, let's analyze (<i>see below</i>) the different
            possibilities of a DB lateral raise, a popular exercise for the medial deltoid. Each scenario is
            using someone with a shoulder to hand length of 70 cm and a DB of 15 kg. Scenario 1 is a
            standard DB lateral raise with a 1 second concentric and a constant velocity. Scenario 2 is
            someone who lifts the weight twice as fast for the first half of the exercise and he then uses
            momentum to not produce any force for the rest of the movement. When comparing those
            two scenarios, we can see that he reaches a higher amount of power than scenario one.
            However, if someone can, with the same weight, create that much velocity, I would probably
            suggest taking heavier dumbbells and using a more complete range of motion, making the
            comparison between the two scenarios impossible. What actually happens most of the time,
            is someone generate the most force possible through the muscle he wants to train and uses
            his body to generate the rest of the momentum, therefore creating a scenario like the third
            one; (a) there is only power in the part of the movement where his deltoids are working and
            (b) his deltoids can't create more contractile force than they could in the first scenario.<br><br>
            <img src="https://samueleblanc.com/Pictures/3 scenarios for a DB lateral raise.png" alt="Lateral raise res profile" id="pic85" class="center"><br>
            <img src="https://samueleblanc.com/Pictures/BB preacher curl 1 sec concentric.png" alt="Preacher curl res profile" id="pic30" style="float: right; margin-left: 7px;">
            Those scenarios can not be used to explain
            every exercise in which you start with a larger
            acceleration, because a DB lateral raise is part
            of the group of exercises that I referenced earlier.
            Why is it the type of exercise that is commonly
            used for this type of behavior? Because inertia
            increases as the exercise is performed. Inertia,
            which increases due to an increase in the
            distance between the joint and the force (gravity
            on the DB), determines the object's resistance in
            a change in motion, while momentum
            determines the amount of motion. So, the more
            momentum <i>and</i> inertia you have, the less force you have to produce to keep lifting the
            weight. If you take an exercise that has a lot of power while your muscle is in its lengthened
            position and it keeps lowering while you lift the weight (i.e. while you contract your muscle),
            you would theoretically need to keep producing force because the object's resistance in
            change of motion would be really low. In other words, the effect of gravity will soon make the
            weight stop moving and you'll have to lift it with the help of your muscle. For instance, doing
            so in a Preacher curl would be less problematic in terms of losing tension at the end of the
            movement, simply because you have less inertia at the end of the movement compared with
            the start.<br><br>
            <h3>The eccentric portion</h3>
            Contrary to the concentric portion, the velocity is inversely proportional to the power for the
            eccentric part of the exercise. Meaning that the slower you go, the more power you get.
            However, the difference after a certain point is quite small. We can clearly see, from the
            graphics below this paragraph, that if you only<sup>‚Ä°</sup> change the eccentric velocity, the difference
            between a 1sec to 2sec eccentric is similar to a 2sec to 5sec eccentric. Obviously, a
            difference of a couple percent at every repetition can lead to major results, but even going
            from not resisting the eccentric at all to offering a slightly significant resistance can benefit
            greatly.<br><br><img src="https://samueleblanc.com/Pictures/DB biceps curl 1 2 5 sec eccentric.png" class="center" alt="Biceps curl eccentric" id="pic85"><br>
            <i><scan class="center">‚Ä° Each scenario is using a 0¬∞ to 120¬∞ ROM, 15kg dumbbells, and 35cm forearms.</scan></i><br><br>
            Another important significance in understanding the impact of velocity in resistance profiles,
            is understanding how to prioritize a specific part of the movement. Below this paragraph, you
            can easily see how a change in tempo can lead to an increase‚Äîor decrease‚Äîin power
            during the eccentric or concentric portion. During the last one or two decades, there has
            been an increasing interest in comparing both parts of an exercise, to better understand their
            specific benefits.<sup><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23448419_The_effects_of_eccentric_versus_concentric_resistance_training_on_muscle_strength_and_mass_in_healthy_adults_A_systematic_review_with_meta-analysis" target="_blank">12</a>,<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259585622_Architectural_functional_and_molecular_responses_to_concentric_and_eccentric_loading_in_human_skeletal_muscle" target="_blank">13</a></sup>
             To prioritize the concentric portion, you need to perform the eccentric
            and the concentric relatively fast. Inversely, to prioritize the eccentric portion, you
            theoretically need to do both slowly. However, doing so would result in a massive increase in
            time under tension (TUT) during a period of high metabolic demand, therefore leading to an
            increase in metabolic stress, which is what prioritizing the concentric portion leads to.<sup><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310474766_Moderate_Load_Eccentric_Exercise_A_Distinct_Novel_Training_Modality" target="_blank">14</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6950543/" target="_blank">15</a></sup>
            Nevertheless, in most cases, I think that voluntarily performing the concentric slowly is not
            the best idea. The concentric <i>will</i> slow down if you reach proximity to failure, in that case,
            you will recruit high threshold motor units, leading to more hypertrophy.<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4731492/" target="_blank">16</a>,<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331718773_Does_Training_to_Failure_Maximize_Muscle_Hypertrophy" target="_blank">17</a></sup> That is why I
            would recommend a training partner if the goal is to make the eccentric portion the main
            focus.<br><br><img src="https://samueleblanc.com/Pictures/DB biceps curl various tempo.png" alt="Biceps curl tempo" class="center" id="pic85"><br>
            <h3>Linking strength curves and resistance profiles</h3><img src="https://samueleblanc.com/Pictures/resistance profile vs strength curve.png" alt="Resistance profile and strength curve" id="pic45" style="float: right; margin-left: 7px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
            An increasingly popular belief is that "resistance profiles should (or must) be similar to the
            strength curve". I want to provide information as to why I do not think of it as a good
            ideology. But, before laying potential reasons, I want to explain the reasoning behind the
            ideology‚Äîwhich is not necessarily completely wrong. Certain coaches or trainers
            recommend to select
            exercise that has a
            resistance profile similar to
            the strength curve of the
            muscle that is being
            trained because that is a
            perfect scenario to be able
            to generate the maximal
            amount of force, therefore
            producing high mechanical
            tension (or stress), which
            seems to be the primary
            stimulus for muscle hypertrophy within resistance training.<sup><a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Fulltext/2010/10000/The_Mechanisms_of_Muscle_Hypertrophy_and_Their.40.aspx" target="_blank">2</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6950543/" target="_blank">15</a>,<a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00685.2018?rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org" target="_blank">18</a>,<a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physiol.00041.2007?rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org" target="_blank">19</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6771594/" target="_blank">20</a>,<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266084792_A_Review_on_the_Mechanisms_of_Blood-Flow_Restriction_Resistance_Training-Induced_Muscle_Hypertrophy" target="_blank">21</a></sup>
            Because, you could,
            in that case, use a weight that is maximally challenging during the entirety of the movement.
            The power would be at its highest when your muscle is able to produce the most contractile
            force possible and the power would lower while the muscle would weaken. For instance, we
            could say that "the resistance profile of a BB preacher curl (using a preacher bench with a
            40¬∞ angle) matches the strength curve of the biceps (or elbow flexors)". I however find it
            difficult to say, based on this statement, that the preacher curl is automatically one of the
            best exercises for the biceps.<br><br>
            There are two major reasons why I tend to object to this statement. First, I think that
            choosing various exercises with different resistance profiles is a good idea in the long term.
            There seems to be an advantage in prioritizing the shortened position if you specifically want
            to hypertrophy the medial part of a muscle.<sup><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236581117_Impact_of_Range_of_Motion_During_Ecologically_Valid_Resistance_Training_Protocols_on_Muscle_Size_Subcutaneous_Fat_and_Strength" target="_blank">22</a></sup>
             Also, I would hypothesize that having a
            resistance profile that challenges the shortened position, when the muscle is at its weakest,
            would increase metabolic stress to a significant level, because being able to generate
            enough contractile force would be quite metabolically demanding. Contrarily, choosing an
            exercise that almost exclusively has power when the muscle has the largest capacity to
            generate force would be a lot less metabolically demanding, therefore serving different
            purposes. We know that periodized training tends to be better for muscle hypertrophy and
            strength,<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6351492/" target="_blank">23</a>,<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28497285/" target="_blank">24</a></sup>
             and I think that including resistance profile in our periodization could be even
            more beneficial in terms of stimulus variation and specificity, and even for the simple benefits
            of the increase in motivation with exercise variety.<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6934277/" target="_blank">25</a></sup><br><br>
            <img src="https://samueleblanc.com/Pictures/Sarcomeres before and after RT.png" alt="Sarcomeres angle" id="pic37" style="float: left; margin-right: 7px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
            Secondly, I would argue that the
            strength curve of a muscle might
            differ with an increase in fatigue and
            a change in muscle architecture due
            to a resistance training protocol. We
            know that sarcomeres, the
            contractile units of the muscle fibers,
            undergo a slow change in angle
            during a workout (figure to the left).<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5495834/" target="_blank">26</a></sup>
            We do not know for sure if it impacts the strength curve, but it would be surprising if the
            change in angle would not modify the capacity to generate contractile force. Nevertheless, I
            could also argue that with metabolite accumulation, an hypoxic environment, and lower
            energy availability, it would be astonishing that one is still able to produce a proportional
            amount of contractile force in the shortened position compared with the lengthened position,
            like prior to the workout. Therefore, suggesting that one must choose exercises that
            "matches" the resistance profile is most likely a bad idea. I would tend to suggest choosing
            an exercise with a resistance profile that "matches" the goal stimulus.<br><br>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            In conclusion, I think that a fundamental understanding in exercise mechanics could help
            coaches and trainers make better decisions for their clients and athletes. I also think that having a 
            software system that uses it could help scientists gain important knowledge that could be applied in increasing the rigor
            and the accuracy of future studies. It would also create new opportunities for large scale, and long term, studies.
