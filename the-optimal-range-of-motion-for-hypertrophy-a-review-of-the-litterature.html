            The purpose of this unofficial review is to hopefully shed some light on various
            misunderstandings concerning range of motion (ROM) and its application. There are
            currently two reviews on the subject.<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6977096/" target="_blank">1</a>,<a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Fulltext/2018/09000/Partial_Compared_with_Full_Range_of_Motion.29.aspx" target="_blank">2</a></sup> 
            They both review the same studies but their
            conclusions are a bit different. Each seems to agree that it's not yet clear which is better.
            However, in the Schoenfeld et al.<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6977096/" target="_blank">1</a></sup> 
            review, full ROM has a small advantage for hypertrophy
            compared to partial ROM. But the Newmire et al.<sup><a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Fulltext/2018/09000/Partial_Compared_with_Full_Range_of_Motion.29.aspx" target="_blank">2</a></sup> 
            review says that both are good and even
            that partial ROM may have an advantage in various conditions. Both reviews are way more
            nuanced than what I just said and even if it looks like they contradict each other, I think that
            they can both be right. Since it's useless for me to repeat everything that these papers are
            saying, I will therefore spend most of that review looking at the unanswered questions.
            First, I think it's important to define what are range of motion's different types. The way I view
            it, is that full ROM is the range at which a joint, or many depending on the exercise, can
            move, and partial ROM is ambiguous because it's a part of the full ROM and it always needs
            to be defined.<br><br>
            <h2>Lower body musculature</h2><img src="https://samueleblanc.com/Pictures/Quad strenght depending of lenght.png" id="myImg1" style="float: right; width: 33%; height: 33%; margin-left: 5px;" alt="Quadriceps strength curve"><div id="myModal" class="modal">

                <div id="caption"></div>
              </div>
            Studies focusing on which ROM is better for
            hypertrophy are using different exercises. That is
            probably why there is a lot of misunderstanding. You
            can't compare 0° - 60° knee flexion on a leg
            extension and with a squat. Some reasons are that
            at the "bottom" of a squat (~ 90° to 140° knee
            flexion) muscles like gluteus maximus and
            adductors helps lifting the weight, therefore they will
            have greater hypertrophy if you squat in a full
            ROM.<sup><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00421-019-04181-y" target="_blank">3</a></sup> 
            Another reason is that you have a lot of
            mechanical tension, which is the primary muscle
            hypertrophy stimulus, at 0° of knee flexion during a
            leg extension compared to basically none at 0° of
            knee flexion during a squat. Quadriceps, are
            stronger at 80° of knee flexion compared to 5°, for example.<sup><a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Abstract/1989/02000/Specificity_of_limited_range_of_motion_variable.15.aspx" target="_blank">4</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1392571/" target="_blank">5</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1357553/?page=11" target="_blank">6</a>,<a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-essr/Citation/1984/01000/Human_Strength_Curves.14.aspx" target="_blank">7</a></sup>
             So, if we keep the previous
            example, a 0° to 60° squat will miss the moment in the lift where the tension is at its greatest
            and a part of the moment where the quadriceps are able to produce a lot of force. In a 0° to
            60° leg extension, tension will still be applied to a great extent. It doesn't mean that partial
            ROM leg extension is a great idea, it means that the impact of doing so will be different from
            a partial ROM squat, even if the degrees of knee flexion are equated.<br><br>
            <h3>Squats</h3>
            There are two studies looking at the hypertrophic response of partial vs full ROM squats.
            However, they used different ROM to do so. The Bloomquist et al.<sup><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00421-013-2642-7" target="_blank">8</a></sup> 
            study used 0-60° of knee
            flexion during the eccentric phase for partial ROM vs 0-120° for full ROM squats, but the
            Kubo et al.<sup><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00421-019-04181-y" target="_blank"></a>3</sup> study used 0-90° vs 0-140° of knee flexion for partial ROM and full ROM
            respectively. They both used untrained individuals, the benefit is that the effects are bigger
            and thus, easier to measure. However, it can give weird results because the effects are
            bigger. Both studies resulted in a greater hypertrophy of the quadriceps muscle with full
            ROM squats, so 120° and 140° of knee flexion. Although there is a difference, it's quite
            minor. It's logic, you take untrained subjects and you make them do squat close to failure,
            they will grow. The difference was more significant between 60° vs 120° than 90° vs 140°. If
            we put both studies in the same basket, 60° squat didn't produce a lot of hypertrophy, but
            90°, 120° and 140° were basically equal when we only looked at the quadriceps. The
            difference was in terms of the hypertrophic response of the adductors and the gluteus
            maximus. In the Kubo et al.<sup><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00421-019-04181-y" target="_blank">3</a></sup> 
            study, the 140° squat produced a significantly bigger
            cross-sectional area (CSA) increase in the adductors and gluteus maximus compared with
            the 90° squat. The Bloomquist et al.<sup><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00421-013-2642-7" target="_blank">8</a></sup> 
            study found a significant increase in the adductors CSA
            with the 60° squat. Why is that? They explain it by the fact that the partial ROM group used
            more load, therefore the muscles that activate at the beginning of the movement grew. It's all
            relative, they only measured CSA of the adductors at "the most proximal sections", which is
            a small part of the adductors that doesn't really change the physical appearance of your
            legs. It's also a part of your adductors that works best closer to a full hip extension compared
            with the bigger part of your adductors, which has a lot of tension at the bottom of a squat
            where hip flexion is more present. That is why we see a significant difference in CSA
            increase of the adductors in the 140° squat compared with the 90° squat, they measured the
            adductor magnus, adductor longus, and adductor brevis which gives a result that is maybe
            more accurate of the actual effect ROM has on adductors. For the gluteus maximus, there is
            only the Kubo et al.<sup><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00421-019-04181-y" target="_blank">3</a></sup> study that looked at it and their conclusion was that a full ROM squat is
            better for glutes hypertrophy. I am confident saying this even if one study was done on the
            subject because there is also a complementary way to look at this. If partial ROM squat is
            not good for glutes hypertrophy and full ROM is good based on that only study, and that a
            full ROM squat is better for gluteus maximus hypertrophy than the hip thrust (which is
            considered to be a good gluteus maximus exercise) based on another study,<sup><a href="https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/a-1082-1126" target="_blank">9</a></sup> I can say with
            a straight face that we don't need another study to confirm this. It also helps to understand
            exercise mechanics, the results become really easy to understand. During a full ROM squat,
            you take the gluteus maximus through a more complete ROM and you benefit from the
            bottom of the movement, which is where there is the greatest amount of tension<sup><a href="https://samueleblanc.com/determining-a-better-way-to-calculate-the-amount-of-tension-on-a-muscle-a-case-study.html" target="_blank">10</a></sup> and
            mechanical tension is the main driver of hypertrophy.<sup><a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Fulltext/2010/10000/The_Mechanisms_of_Muscle_Hypertrophy_and_Their.40.aspx" target="_blank">11</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6950543/" target="_blank">12</a>,<a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00685.2018" target="_blank">25</a></sup><br><br>
            <h3>Leg extension and complete leg training</h3>
            The other two studies that looked at how ROM influence hypertrophy for the lower body
            musculature either used leg extension<sup><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326256990_Influence_of_full_range_of_motion_vs_equalized_partial_range_of_motion_training_on_muscle_architecture_and_mechanical_properties" target="_blank">13</a></sup> or a full leg training<sup><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236581117_Impact_of_Range_of_Motion_During_Ecologically_Valid_Resistance_Training_Protocols_on_Muscle_Size_Subcutaneous_Fat_and_Strength" target="_blank">14</a></sup>. The Valamatos et al.<sup><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326256990_Influence_of_full_range_of_motion_vs_equalized_partial_range_of_motion_training_on_muscle_architecture_and_mechanical_properties" target="_blank">13</a></sup> study,
            which measured CSA increase with a partial or full ROM leg extension of 0° - 60° or 0° -
            100° of knee flexion respectively. They only measured the vastus lateralis muscle. The
            results correspond with the previous studies, the full ROM group gained more muscle but it's
            barely significant. However, even if time under tension was equated in that study, full ROM
            seemed to have a benefit. Something that needs to be taken into consideration is the fact
            that, except the control group who didn't train, each participant trained with a partial ROM
            with one leg and full ROM with the other. The leg doing full ROM was randomly selected and
            the other leg was automatically in the partial ROM group. The thing is, we now know that
            training one side of the body might have an impact on the other side.<sup><a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00971.2017" target="_blank">15</a></sup> The fact that one leg
            was either doing a 60° to 0° or 100° to 0° knee extension probably had an impact on the
            other leg. The result is still that full ROM seemed to be better for hypertrophy but maybe the
            difference would have been bigger between partial and full ROM if they didn't use the same
            subjects to do both approaches.<br><br><img src="https://samueleblanc.com/Pictures/Resistance training program outline.png" id="myImg2" alt="Workout program; McMahon, Gerard E et al." style="float: left; width: 35%; height: 35%; margin-right: 7px;"><div id="myModal" class="modal">

              </div>
            What about the full leg training study?<sup><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236581117_Impact_of_Range_of_Motion_During_Ecologically_Valid_Resistance_Training_Protocols_on_Muscle_Size_Subcutaneous_Fat_and_Strength" target="_blank">14</a></sup> They
            compared 0° to 50° and 0° to 90° of knee
            flexion for partial ROM and full ROM
            respectively. So, their full ROM was the partial
            ROM of the Kubo et al. research.<sup><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00421-019-04181-y" target="_blank">3</a></sup> Their
            training program (as shown on the side of this
            paragraph) was a mix of different exercises
            that put emphasis on different parts of the
            movement. Squats, leg presses, split squats
            and lunges have a lot of tension when the
            quadriceps are in a lengthen position. Leg
            extension has a constant tension throughout
            the movement compared with free weight exercises. Depending on which model of Pulse
            Fitness leg extension was used for the research, maybe there was a slight deload close to
            knee extension but it's insignificant compared with the deload at the end of a squat, for
            example. They also used isometric contraction (Sampson chair / Wall sit) during the
            resistance training program. This particular research was the closest to a real life situation
            due to the fact that it was a complete leg workout and also that the degrees of knee flexion
            used were similar to what most people use in the gym. The results were quite clear, 90° of
            knee flexion for the eccentric phase produced more hypertrophy than 0° to 50°. The most
            distal and proximal part of the vastus lateralis had a significant increase in CSA in the full vs
            partial ROM. However, at 50% of femur length they didn't see a difference between the two
            groups. It is in line with studies on concentric versus eccentric training. Concentric training
            tends to increase CSA at the medial part of a muscle compared with the distal and the
            proximal portion.<sup><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259585622_Architectural_functional_and_molecular_responses_to_concentric_and_eccentric_loading_in_human_skeletal_muscle" target="_blank">21</a>,</sup><sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5495834/" target="_blank">22</a></sup>
             Even if there is technically a difference between only performing the
            concentric portion and simply doing the part of the movement where the muscle is most
            contracted are different, I would suggest that the underlying mechanism regarding the
            hypertrophic stimuli specific to that exercise are similar in these scenarios. Both would
            increase metabolic stress to a higher degree, independent of mechanical stress, than a
            regular full ROM exercise, due to muscles being in a almost constant contracting (or
            shortened) state.<sup><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31034463/" target="_blank">19</a>,<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23448419_The_effects_of_eccentric_versus_concentric_resistance_training_on_muscle_strength_and_mass_in_healthy_adults_A_systematic_review_with_meta-analysis" target="_blank">23</a>,<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266084792_A_Review_on_the_Mechanisms_of_Blood-Flow_Restriction_Resistance_Training-Induced_Muscle_Hypertrophy" target="_blank">24</a></sup><br><br>

            Based on the four papers that looked at the
            hypertrophic response of different ROM on lower
            body musculature, it looks like 50° and 60° are
            suboptimal for hypertrophy and that 90°, 100°,
            120° and 140° are basically equal, and better than
            partial ROM, in term of quadriceps hypertrophy. If
            your goal is overall lower body development, doing
            a bigger ROM, like 120° or 140° of knee flexion is
            probably a good idea because you can also
            increase CSA of the adductors and gluteus maximus.<br>
            <h2>Upper body musculature</h2><img src="https://samueleblanc.com/Pictures/Preacher curl partial vs full ROM.png" id="myImg4" alt="Preacher curl ROM" style="float: left; width: 25%; height: 25%; margin-right: 7px;"><div id="myModal" class="modal">

            The Pinto et al. study looked at CSA increase of the
            elbow flexor (biceps brachii, brachialis and
            brachioradialis).<sup><a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2012/08000/effect_of_range_of_motion_on_muscle_strength_and.17.aspx#:~:text=Effect%20of%20range%20of%20motion%20on%20muscle%20strength%20and%20thickness.&text=Also%2C%20FULL%201RM%20strength%20was,7.83%20%C2%B1%204.9%20for%20PART" target="_blank">16</a></sup> They compared 0° of elbow
            flexion to 130° for the full ROM group and 50° to
            100° of elbow flexion for the partial ROM group
            during a preacher curl. It is different from every
            lower body musculature paper because they used
            the middle of the movement to analyze the effect of
            different ROM on hypertrophy. They put a metallic
            bar at 50° and another one at 100° of elbow flexion
            so that the ROM was tightly regulated within the
            partial ROM group. However, it can be problematic
            if they are not taught properly to not bounce the
            weight on the metallic bars. More so because they were untrained individuals and it can be
            tempting to use the metallic bars to facilitate the change in direction. The results of this study
            suggested that full ROM was better for hypertrophy of the elbow flexors but that difference
            was extremely small. I think that it can be explained by the fact that; (a) they were untrained
            individuals so they tend to respond a lot no matter what; (b) the partial ROM group did more
            volume and we know that more volume is often correlated with better hypertrophy;<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6303131/" target="_blank">17</a>,<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305455324_Dose-response_relationship_between_weekly_resistance_training_volume_and_increases_in_muscle_mass_A_systematic_review_and_meta-analysis" target="_blank">18</a></sup> (c) the
            partial ROM group used more load; (d) the partial ROM was in the part of the movement
            where tension was at its highest. It is normal for the partial ROM group to use more load, the
            difference was however quite big. The partial ROM group, compared with other studies,
            used only the part of the movement where tension is at its highest, that's why I don't think we
            can justify a difference in about 50% of the weight being used. Nonetheless, the full ROM
            group had a bigger CSA increase compared with partial ROM.<br><br>
            A Goto et al. study<sup><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31034463/" target="_blank">19</a></sup> 
            looked at the triceps brachii hypertrophy of a partial ROM lying barbell
            (BB) triceps extension compared with a full ROM. The partial ROM group did 90° to 45°
            elbow extension while the other group went from a completely flexed (120°) elbow to a full
            (0°) elbow extension. At first glance, it looked quite similar to the previous (preacher curl)
            study in terms of exercise and ROM selection. However, the results were different, the partial
            ROM group gained more muscle and the CSA increase difference was actually quite big.
            That particular study, because of the fact that the result differs from the other studies, really
            helps to shape the understanding of how to apply ROM to a resistance training program.
            First, I want to note a couple key differences between the preacher curl study and this one:
            (a) partial ROM group in the triceps hypertrophy study didn't use more load than the full
            ROM group. However, the speed (angular velocity) at which they lifted the weight was slower
            in the partial ROM group, meaning that they constantly controlled the weight with an active
            muscular contraction; (b) a lying BB extension puts the triceps in a more lengthen position
            compared with the preacher curl, which puts the biceps in a more shorten position, it's all
            due to the impact of a shoulder flexion on both of these muscle. The former tends to be
            better for hypertrophy;<sup><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33009197/" target="_blank">20</a></sup>
             (c) the study was done on trained individuals; (d) no matter the
            ROM of a preacher curl the biceps are always in line with the tension. On the other hand,
            based on the individual differences in anatomy and mobility, it is not the case for a lying BB
            triceps extension. You need to have an above average mobility if you are able to do that
            exercise in a full ROM and always keep your humerus perpendicular to the floor and in line
            with gravity, while having a pronated grip (figure 5). To cope with that and to validate our
            understanding of exercise mechanic; a study where they would've used a shoulder width —
            neutral (or hammer) grip would be a great idea. Instead of a barbell, they would've needed a
            multi grip bar (figure 6). I think that, with those changes, a longer ROM would actually be
            better for triceps hypertrophy.<br><br> <img src="https://samueleblanc.com/Pictures/pronated grip and multi grip bar.png" id="myImg5" alt="Grip and Bar" style="width: 55%; height: 55%;" class="center"><div id="myModal" class="modal">

            <h2>Discussion</h2>
            Based on the finding of the six studies that looked at the difference in cross-sectional area
            (CSA) increase between a full range of motion (ROM) versus a partial ROM, we really can't
            say that "full ROM is better for hypertrophy" and even less that "partial ROM is better for
            hypertrophy". Full ROM is interesting if you want to increase muscle mass of different
            muscles without being specific (eg. squats for the lower body instead of squats for
            quadriceps). The problem with that approach is that it can become a problem if you only
            need quadriceps hypertrophy, to keep the same example. This is where active ROM comes
            into play. Based on the six research that we have and our understanding of exercise
            mechanics, I think that it is, and will always be, impossible to say if full ROM is better than
            partial ROM without adding active ROM into the equation and precisely defining every type
            of ROM. The way I view it is that full ROM is the range at which a (or many depending of the
            exercise) joint can move, partial ROM is a part of the full ROM and it always needs to be
            defined and active ROM is the range at which the specific muscle you want to train is the
            primary mover of the tension. So, full ROM is mostly about the joint, partial ROM is
            ambiguous and active ROM is about a specific muscle. When we add active ROM
            everything becomes more clear, mostly because we lose the vagueness of partial ROM. We
            could also define active ROM as full ROM, but only if; (a) we are not talking about the full
            ROM of a joint but of a specific muscle; (b) the exercise selection is made so that the athlete
            can take that specific muscle into a full ROM (see (a)) while keeping that specific muscle the
            primary mover; (c) we agree that it can differ from person to person. In that scenario: active
            ROM = full ROM. However, I think that keeping the terms partial, active and full ROM is a
            good idea due to its simplicity of understanding for the general public who wants to lift weight
            for health, physique or performance benefits. With active ROM, we can explain why a 60°
            squat is suboptimal for quadriceps hypertrophy but that 90° of knee flexion or more are all
            equally good for hypertrophy of the quadriceps. We can also explain why a full ROM
            preacher curl is better for hypertrophy than a partial ROM, but that it's the opposite for a lying
            BB triceps extension. Everything becomes more clear when we add that variable and that
            we understand ROM should be about the muscle and not the joint.<br><br>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            In the future, I think that trying to understand exercise mechanics to a higher degree,
            understanding how to calculate the amount of tension on a specific muscle, having better
            cues to tell athletes how to understand and apply active range of motion, and finding better
            ways to set-up for an exercise to be capable of applying the maximum amount of tension,
            not activation, on the targeted muscle are better lines of research than pursuing with range
            of motion studies.<br><br>
            I also want to say that I did not invent the term "active ROM". I don't know who did, but if I
            need to credit someone, I will credit Kassem Hanson. I heard it from him first and even if he
            didn't invent that, he definitely found some amazing thing about hypertrophy training that no
            one found before him and I want to thank him for all the research he and his team are
            currently doing outside of academia.<br><br>
