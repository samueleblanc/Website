                 therefore making it possible to compute its main stimulus.</span></p6></div><br><br>
There are different approaches on how to divide training stimuli. The one that's most often used in the
 general public is:<br>
- Strength or Neural;<br>
- Hypertrophy or Mechanical Stress;<br>
- Endurance or Metabolic stress.*<br>
Hence creating a dichotomy between three separated classes. The obvious problem in that approach is
 limiting yourself to one stimulus, even if it is possible to work strength and hypertrophy at the 
 same time, for example. We must apply nuance since there's a difference between doing a 1 RM 
 (repetition maximum) and 6 RM, the first being almost exclusively for strength purposes and the
  latter being a potential median between strength and hypertrophy, depending on many other variables.<br><br>
<i>*I will use these terms as if they are synonyms.</i><br><br>
<h3>Variables used</h3>
The number of repetitions (reps) is the evident first answer. Doing more reps, independently of 
other metrics, will slowly tilt the stimulus into the metabolic stress category. The main reason
 being an increase in time under tension (TUT), that will most likely lead to an increase in energy
  (glucose) demand, a reduction in oxygen availability, an increase in lactate concentration and 
  nitric oxide production. All of which are closely linked to metabolic work. The resistance profile
   is also an extremely important metric.<sup>†</sup> Like explained in the article linked below, if you have
    an exercise which makes it more difficult to execute (due to an increase in power) in the part
     of the movement where the muscle is at its weakest, the metabolic demand will rise and vise versa.
The tempo also needs to be taken into account. The first and third number are already included 
in the resistance profile, but not the second and last. They manifest a clear impact in the 
training stimulus, since spending more time in the most metabolically demanding part of the 
movement (shortened muscle) will increase the metabolic demand, and spending time in the lengthened
 position will reduce the "stretch reflex" which is an often important component of strength training.
  The fact that the concentric part of the movement generates more power than the eccentric part (or 
  if the opposite is true) must be included in the process of finding the main stimulus or stimuli. 
  Since the concentric portion demands more energy than the eccentric, prioritizing the concentric, 
  for instance, will lead to a slightly more metabolically demanding workout.<br><br>

<h3>The equation and the program</h3><img src="https://samueleblanc.com/Pictures/Training stimulus.png" alt="Sigmoid function" id="pic45" style="float: right;">
A sigmoid function (<i>right</i>) was chosen, due to its property of nuance in the middle and none 
in the extremes. Doing 30 reps per set or 100 reps are both in the endurance world, but 8 reps could be in any 
category, depending on every variable.<br><br>
The current equation is most likely far from being the best possible one. It only works with single joint movement, 
with free weights. This version also only functions with muscles that shorten as the joint angle increases, but 
that would be extremely simple to adjust. It also needs a lot more accuracy. The current equation is almost built 
on a guess of how much impact a single variable has on determining  the stimulus. It is therefore necessary to come 
up with new ways to test this. Furthermore, changing the way we get data is essential. Going from multiple input 
functions where the user enters variables to a computer vision program that automatically inputs all of them would 
help resolve many of the current issues.<br><br>

<h3>Results</h3>
Instead of naming training stimuli "strength", "hypertrophy", "glycolytic" or any other traditional way that we think about it. I chose to go down a level of abstraction since we now have the tools to do so and call a training stimulus by a number between 0 and 1. The lower the number, the closer it is to absolute strength work and the higher, the closer to absolute endurance. Muscle hypertrophy can happen at any number, but is predominant the closer it is to 0.5.<br>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Like said above, finding a way to prove how much influence a variable has over the outcome is necessary to provide us 
with the actual stimulus. A statistical analysis of resistance training studies and being able to link the mechanics of 
the exercise to the muscle architecture’s is the starting point in achieving that.<br><br>
Being able to accurately find the stimulus of an exercise is the first step toward finding the outcome of a training, and 
then translating that into a full periodization based on the main goal, their strength and their weakness.<br><br><br></div></p>
